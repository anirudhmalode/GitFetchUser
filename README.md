# GitFetchUser
A repo for fetching the github user information.

1. This is the repository/ project to fetch information of any github user.

2. Initially, have to create one github application so that, collection of tokens will be generated so that, we can insert it into our 
   code & we will have access to the github API.
   
3. Secondly, As this repository is cloned first thing is to check for the package.json file. And, hence, we have to initialize bootstrap 
   so that, have to run "npm install" to install the nod_modules to the folder.
   
4. Remove ".gitignore".
   
5. Thirdly, Have to install live-server using "npm install live-server -g". We can also run the using "npm start" but, the styling effects
   willnot be that much better.
   
6. Finally to run the application have to run the command "live-server".
